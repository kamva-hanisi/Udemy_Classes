Write a C# program to print the following output:

1 2 3 4 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 7 8 9 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10


Each number should be printed by using the loop variable.

Don't print full line at-a-time as string.

For example, don't write statements as:

System.Console.WriteLine("1 2 3 4 7 8 9 10");



Use for loop, break and continue statements to bring the output.
