use "if" to categorize height"

Height categories:

Height is less than 150 cm = "Dwarf"

Height is between 150 cm and 165 cm = "Average height"

Height is between 165 cm and 195 cm = "Tall"

Height is above 195 cm = "Abnormal height"



Note: 1 inch = 2.54 centimeter

You need to convert the input value (inches) into centimeters.



Eg:

Input: 75

Output: Tall
